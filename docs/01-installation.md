Once the installation completes, you‚Äôll be prompted to:
- Set an Administrator password
- Customize settings
- Begin initial configuration

üìå Now you're ready to proceed to the next steps:
1. Setting a Static IP  
2. Configuring Active Directory (AD)  
3. Promoting the server to a Domain Controller (DC)

These will be covered in the next parts of this documentation series.
